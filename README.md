# Part XIX: two-dimensional Kalman filter

In this part, you will learn how you can measure the vertical velocity and altitude of your quadcopter by combining the measurements of the MPU6050 accelerometer and BMP280 altitude sensors through a two-dimensional Kalman filter. All explanations can be found in the Youtube video below, and the full code is given in this repository.
